# ImGuiSharp
ImGuiSharp is a binding library for [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for C# that aims to expose as many apis as possible and stay at the most updated version of imgui and cimgui.

‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning**: This is a beta version, and is not yet ready for use.‚ö†Ô∏è

üî¥**Observation**: The library is only compiled for Windows-x64 and only tested on windows for now.üî¥

**WIP**: Nuget package and CI build are not yet ready.

This can be considered a fork of the awesome project by mellinoe [ImGui.Net](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET), the main differences between the two are:

- This library will be "bloated" it will contain all ImGui's features including internal ones and 3rd party libraries as well, if you want/need a smaller version of ImGuiSharp, you can use the [ImGui.Net](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET) instead.
- CodeGenerator is being refactored to be easier to read and modify.
- ImGuiSharp will expose the ImGui internal headers.
- ImPlot,ImNodes,ImGuizmo added to the list of supported libraries.
- Provides easy to use scripts to update, build and test ImGuiSharp.
