# ImGuiSharp
ImGuiSharp is a binding library for [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for C#

This can be considered a fork of the awesome project by mellinoe [ImGui.Net](https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET), the main differences between the two are:

- ImGuiSharp will expose the ImGui internal headers
- ImPlot
- ImNodes
- ImGuizmo
- Provides easy to use scripts to update, build and test ImGuiSharp

> Dear ImGui is designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content creation tools and visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries.
