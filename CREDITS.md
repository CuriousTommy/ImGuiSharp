https://github.com/mellinoe/ImGui.NET
> This is a .NET wrapper for the immediate mode GUI library, Dear ImGui. ImGui.NET lets you build graphical interfaces using a simple immediate-mode style. ImGui.NET is a .NET Standard library, and can be used on all major .NET runtimes and operating systems.

https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
> Dear ImGui is designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content creation tools and visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries.

> This is a thin c-api wrapper for the excellent C++ intermediate gui imgui. This library is intended as a intermediate layer to be able to use imgui from other languages that can interface with C .

https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid
>Veldrid is a cross-platform, graphics API-agnostic rendering and compute library for .NET. It provides a powerful, unified interface to a system's GPU and includes more advanced features than any other .NET library. Unlike other platform- or vendor-specific technologies, Veldrid can be used to create high-performance 3D applications that are truly portable.

https://github.com/epezent/implot
>ImPlot is an immediate mode, GPU accelerated plotting library for Dear ImGui. It aims to provide a first-class API that ImGui fans will love. ImPlot is well suited for visualizing program data in real-time or creating interactive plots, and requires minimal code to integrate. Just like ImGui, it does not burden the end user with GUI state management, avoids STL containers and C++ headers, and has no external dependencies except for ImGui itself.

https://github.com/Nelarius/imnodes
>Imnodes aims to provide a simple, immediate-mode interface for creating a node editor within an ImGui window. Imnodes provides simple, customizable building blocks that a user needs to build their node editor.
